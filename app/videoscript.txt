When launching the app for the first time, you get a simple login screen. To
streamline this interface with our back-end, Firebase, we use FirebaseUI
integration. This enables email and Google sign-in for now, and also
future-proofs the app by providing the framework to later add other
authentication options like Facebook and Instagram.

After signing in, you will get to the main menu, with three modules. One to get
advice from other users, one to provide feedback, and the Advice Portal to view
previously received feedback.

The back-end is intricately designed, <SOMETHING SOMETHING>

The user flow from sign-in screen to main menu to the different menus
(fragments) are fairly complicated on our end, but is easy for the user.

So this is the "Get advice" mode. Here, the user can provide a first name,
category for the post and what occastion it's for, for instance a wedding,
hiking trip etc. Once a photo is selected, you can preview it before sharing it
with the rest of the huge, already existing community.
